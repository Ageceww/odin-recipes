    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <un>
        <li><strong>2 potatoes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 carrots</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 large dill pickles</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 onion</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 cup frozen peas</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoon mayonnaise</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon grainy mustard</strong></li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, place carrots and potatoes with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, and cook potatoes and
            carrots until easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Cook three hard boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Peel potatoes, carrots and eggs (I use the back of a sharp paring knife to peel the potatoes and carrots).
            Chop finely. Combine in a large bowl with onions, pickles, peas and dressing ingredients. Mix until well
            combined – eggs will break a little, and that's OK – they will help flavour the sauce. Taste and correct
            seasonings. Let sit In the fridge for at least a couple of hours, preferably overnight. Serve with a little
            bit of fresh dill on the side.</li>
    </ol>
